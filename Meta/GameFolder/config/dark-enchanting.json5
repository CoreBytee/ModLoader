  //Enchantments contain a certain weight, viewable in the Minecraft Wiki.
  //Weight Divisor is used to determine a specialWeightFactor.
  //We perform the calculation:
  //
  //(11 - weight) / weightDivisor = specialWeightFactor
  //
  //specialWeightFactor will ALWAYS be greater than 1. Meaning, if the calculation provides a specialWeightFactor less than 1, we will just use 1 instead.
  //
  //For example, Sharpness has a weight of 10, while Mending will have a weight of 2.
  //In the equation, Sharpness will have a factor of 1 while Mending will have a factor of 4.5 (WITH DEFAULTS).
